# Overview of Machine Learning

## Decision Trees
- classication
- flowchart like structure
- homogeneous class distribtions are preferred with nodes

## Linear Reg
- assumptions - many
- no multicollinearity
- features and residuals should be normally distributed
- mean of residual = 0

---
## Random Forest
- boostraping

## SVM
